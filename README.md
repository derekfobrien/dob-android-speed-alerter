# dob-android-speed-alerter
An android app to provide an audible signal to a set speed being exceeded

The following files go in the locations as follows, all within the res folder:
- The speed limit signs go into the drawable folder
- The ic_speedalerter_???? files are the icons that were made specifically for this app. The substring after the second underscore
  relates to the size of display, and the name of the folder each PNG file goes into. For example, ic_speed_alerter_xhdpi.png goes
  into mipmap-xhdpi folder, and so on.
- The carhorn.mp3 file goes into the raw folder.
- colors.xml, strings.xml and styles.xml go into the values folder
- activity_main.xml, display_fragment.xml and setspeed_fragment.xml all go into the layout folder.
- activity_main_land.xml is a landscape version of the other activity_main file, and it goes into a layout_land folder

DISCLAIMER:
This app is written for educational purposes only and I do not recommend relying on it while driving, to help you keep within
various speed limits. You will find that there will be a small discrepancy in the speed indicated by any GPS-driven app, and
a vehicle's speedometer. 

Also, using this app while driving is not recommended, with the possible exception of having a passenger with you in the
vehicle. Road safety must always come first.

If you use this app while driving, you do so at your own risk!
